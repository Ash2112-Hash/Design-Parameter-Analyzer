# Hip-Implant-Verifier

The Python Hip Implant Verifier is a computer application that serves to analyze and verify your selected design parameters by relying on the material properties and physical dimensions of the implant stem. Using the integrated menu system, the application receives the user's selection of a subprogram (desired sub-function of the application), calculates the corresponding property and displays the value on the terminal window or imports data to an independent text file.

The current iteration of DPV utilizes properties of a Hip Implant to verify if the chosen design paramters of the appliance will be functional for the patient. Feel free to modify the properties to suite your chosen appliance.
